Team Homework Assignment 3: Team Project. 

==Due 6A==

* Description:

(1) Complete a "Hello World" type of initial scenario for Heroku
(2) Complete a "Hello World" type of initial scenario for the Fitbit API
(3) Complete a "Hello World" type of initial scenario for the Garmin API
(4) Include information about (1-3) in the "Technology" section of the team project document and outline how these technologies will be used in the team project.
(5) As always, make progress according to your own sprint planning, and document the scrum meeting in the team meeting log section.
(6) Revise and refine the "Requirement" section
(7) Use justinmind prototyper or another tool of your choice to develop GUI mockups for the food diary feature and the exercise data capture feature. (Include both screenshots and the original prototyper file in your project archive.)

==Due 6B==
(1) Add the Analysis section to your team documentation. It should include at least a class diagram (with attributes and operations) and a sequence diagram that realizes the top priority use case in your project.
(2) Complete the API demo's that were not completed from the previous assignment.
(3) Submission: check sample code and project documentation into your team GIT repository.

==Due 7B==
(1) Generate a document from your Sprint planning meeting, document both team goals and individual goals for the 2nd Sprint. End of Sprint demo time: 10/19 Friday @ the EECS Retreat. Identify at least one student from each team to perform the demo. Each team must bring a computer (to show demo in Virtual Box) and an Android tablet. Document student names in the submission.
(2) Complete Fitbit API demo + Heroku demo by deploying the Fitbit sample code to Heroku.

==Due 8A==
(1) Send a PDF document to the class mailing list with the complete project documentation so far, which should include the requirement and the analysis sections. This is to get ready for peer review of the project document and a discussion on what works and what doesn't work with the Unified Software Development Process. If the way you organize your project documents makes it time-consuming to generate the PDF document, feel free to suggest alternative ways to share the documents with the rest of the class.

==Due 10A==
(1) Define the API between the server component and the client app. Make this a section in your team document.
(2) A functional food diary demo with the photos taken being sent to a server.
(3) Starting from session 9A, the following should be sent to the class mailing list on the same day as the meetings. (They should still be archived in team documentation as before.)
--Sprint planning document (sprint backlog and initial individual assignments) after the Sprint planning meeting
--Scrum dialy updates (twice weekly) after each Scrum meeting. Attach GIT log to the updates to provide concrete information for the items in the update. The following is an example:

==Due 12A==

Use ArgoUML to develop/refine the use case diagram, sequence diagram, and class diagram in your team project. Check in the ArgoUML files to your team project, and update your project document with the new diagrams.

==Due 15A==

Perform automatic testing for a component of your project (e.g. a class, a member function in a class, or a server API function). In automatic testing, write a simple script or app to test your component-under-test with predetermined, hard-coded operations and parameters. Include at least three test cases. Use jUnit if you can. Include in the project documentation the code you wrote for testing, the exact test output, and the testing result. 

Submission: Create a subfolder in this directory for your team. Check in your submission to that folder. (Be sure to include this content in your final team project documentation.)
